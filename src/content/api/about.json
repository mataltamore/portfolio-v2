Currently, I'm working at Deloitte Digital, a consultancy company where I've developed with React.js, Next.js and SASS. During my free time I really like to study new open source stuff like frameworks, libraries and languages, and maybe I'd put these into new projects in my work or in my github. Also I love manga and play videogames with my friends!",
